    Q: "Accordian as musical instrument?",
    A: `The accordion is a portable, box-shaped musical instrument that produces sound by pushing air through reeds using a bellows. It has a keyboard or buttons on one side (right hand) for playing melodies and bass buttons on the other (left hand) for chords and accompaniment.
